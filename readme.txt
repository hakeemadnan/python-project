Here’s a README file for your Tetris game project:
Tetris Game

##Created by: **Adnan Mushtaq**

## Project Overview
This project is a classic Tetris game developed using the Pygame library in Python. It was created as part of my college project to demonstrate proficiency in game development and working with 2D graphics. The game replicates the original Tetris mechanics, allowing users to play and enjoy one of the most iconic games of all time.

## Features
- **Classic Tetris Mechanics**: Rotating, moving, and dropping Tetriminoes.
- **Scoring System**: Players earn points by completing rows.
- **Next Piece Preview**: A preview of the next block is displayed to help players plan their moves.
- **Game Over Detection**: The game ends when the blocks reach the top of the screen.
- **Smooth Controls**: Arrow keys allow for smooth block movement and rotation.

## Installation
To run this project, you'll need to have Python and Pygame installed.

### 1. Install Python
Make sure Python (version 3.x) is installed on your machine. You can download it from the official website: [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### 2. Install Pygame
To install Pygame, run the following command:
```bash
pip install pygame
```

### 3. Clone or Download the Project
You can clone this repository or download the zip file and extract it to your desired directory.

### 4. Running the Game
Navigate to the directory where the project is located and run the following command:
```bash
python main.py
```

## How to Play
- Use the **left** and **right arrow keys** to move the blocks horizontally.
- Use the **up arrow key** to rotate the blocks.
- Use the **down arrow key** to speed up the block's descent.
- The goal is to complete horizontal lines, which will clear them from the board and score points.
