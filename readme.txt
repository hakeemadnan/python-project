Tetris Game

Created by: Adnan Mushtaq

Project Overview
This project is a classic Tetris game developed using the Pygame library in Python. It was created as part of my college project to demonstrate proficiency in game development and working with 2D graphics. The game replicates the original Tetris mechanics, allowing users to play and enjoy one of the most iconic games of all time.

Features

- Classic Tetris mechanics: rotating, moving, and dropping Tetriminoes.

- Scoring system: players earn points by completing rows.

- Next piece preview: a preview of the next block is displayed to help players plan their moves.

- Game over detection: the game ends when the blocks reach the top of the screen.

- Smooth controls: arrow keys allow for smooth block movement and rotation.
